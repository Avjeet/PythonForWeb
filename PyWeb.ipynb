    "# 1. Working with web APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is API?**<br>\n",
    "    API is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact. \n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is web API?**<br>\n",
    "    Web API is a framework for building HTTP services that can be consumed by a broad range of clients including browsers, mobiles, iphone and tablets.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "- **Some examples of public web APIs:**\n",
    "    - [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api)\n",
    "    - [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)\n",
    "    - [Google API explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/)\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is REST?**<br>\n",
    "    REST is an architectural style followed by web services, in which, they allow requesting systems to access and manipulate their Web resources using a uniform and predefined set of **stateless operations**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >In computing, a stateless protocol is a communications protocol in which no information is retained by either sender or receiver. The sender transmits a packet to the receiver and does not expect an acknowledgment of receipt. There is nothing saved that has to be remembered by the next transaction. The server must be able to completely understand the client request without using any server context or server session state. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   Advantages of REST:\n",
    "   - As the transactions are stateless, we can direct them to any instance of the web service. (As no sessions are involved). Hence, the web service can scale to accommodate load changes.\n",
    "   - Binding to a service through an API is a matter of controlling how the URL is decoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "- **Types of HTTP requests**\n",
    "    - GET\n",
    "    - POST\n",
    "    - DELETE\n",
    "    - PUT\n",
    "    - PATCH, etc."
